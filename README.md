# Learning Security üìñ

> This is a guide that will show you how to install:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor
- [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/) - Toolbox
- [Juiceshop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) - Objective

> Please feel free to use this to get started in the wonderful world of security!

## Objective ‚úîÔ∏è

This is intended for people who don't quite know where or how to start learning about security. I found 
that this is one of the hardest steps, and while there are a lot of tools available they all assume that you
have some working knowledge in the first place.

This is why I created this project. To help you when the spirit is willing but the mind is overwhelmed by all the 
information out there.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Follow along with this guide and by the end you will have a Kali security workstation that you can play around in 
and a Juiceshop container that you will be hacking.

### Code Editor - Visual Studio Code
